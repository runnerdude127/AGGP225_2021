	Seekers are RED and can shoot.
	Hiders that become RED become seekers.
	Seekers win if everyone becomes RED
	Hiders win if there are still hiders left when time runs out.
Add HOT COLOR
	All players are some neutral color, and can't shoot.
	One player is selected to become RED, who can shoot.
	The player who has the HOT COLOR (RED) must shoot another player to give them the color, returning them to normal.
	If the person who has the HOT COLOR remains that way for too long, they explode, and are eliminated.
	Another random player is selected. This continues until there is only one player left.

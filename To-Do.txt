______________

issues to fix:
all the characters are acting strangely. Jumping isn't visible to other players, and nametags are goin crazy.
pressing escape while chatting leads to lockup weirdness
strafing momentum causes most shots to do no damage but still play a hitconfirm sound... was this a photon-related issue?
fix the owner symbol when the owner leaves
allow other players in a lobby to view the countdown timer before a game starts
have some rhyme or reason to the colors of rooms in the lobby


Game -> Time runs out -> Room
Game -> Win condition met -> Room

The game returns to the room with updated scores. Given that the room is still full, the game will start back up again after a 10 second wait.
